# Machine Learning using Python to Predict Indian Trade Data Values
--- 
# Overview 

The project deals with the prediction of Indian trade data values
 from pre existing data sets of import and export statistics. 
 The primary focus is to predict as accurately as possible the 
 total dollar value of imports and exports in the future.

# Aims

## Predict Future Import Values

The primary objective is to use linear regression to estimate the total value of trade that will take place in the next 5 years (2019 to 2023).   

## Visualize The Given Data 

The data is of a large magnitude and therefore is difficult to comprehend in itâ€™s given form.
Visualizations are powerful tools that allow large amounts of data to be presented in an intuitive manner

## Identify Key Features

The combination of predictions and visualizations will allow us to identify the key factors that affect the trends that we are attempting to chart.

# The Dataset

The dataset consists of Indian import data for the years 2010 to 2018.
It was taken from the popular data science forum [Kaggle.](kaggle.com)
